# Get-Index-by-Inside-of-Polygon-of-a-Picture
At times we run into the problem of identifying which pixels in the image are within a certain polygon whether it is convex or non-convex. For this I developed a function to identify which indexes are within a certain polygon, this is important in the need to build new variables for a learning problem that was my case.
